# Basic concepts

This section introduces some concepts that you need to understand when
you are new to DataMiner. These concepts will return throughout the
DataMiner Help, so if you are not yet familiar with them, it is
advisable to read through this section before you go on to the rest of
the documentation.

## This section consists of the following topics:

•[DataMiner Agent and client](#XREF_55911_DataMiner_Agent)

•[System components](#XREF_75900_System_components)

•[DataMiner functionalities](#XREF_32022_DataMiner)

•[DataMiner modules](#XREF_84138_DataMiner_modules)

•[DataMiner Standard Apps](#XREF_36366_DataMiner_Solutions)

## DataMiner Agent and client

To be able to work with DataMiner, you must have at least one DataMiner
Agent and a DataMiner client.

| Concept                | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DataMiner Agent or DMA | A piece of hardware running the DataMiner Software           |
| DataMiner Client       | An entity communicating with the Agent.  The term is mostly used to denote a client application that allows users to interact with the DataMiner Agent |

System components

On a DataMiner Agent you can find different kinds of “objects”,
representing components of your system:

| Concept            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| An element         | A device that is monitored by the DataMiner System           |
| A parameter        | A variable that refers to pieces of data in the system.  Its value may be detected by DataMiner, or may depend on user input.  Values may be part of a range limited by a particular minimum or maximum, or part of a limited set of predetermined values. |
| A service          | A group of elements or partial elements, combined from the perspective of a particular business aspect.  As such, a DataMiner service can reflect all components required for an actual business service. |
| A view             | A folder that can contain elements, services and other DataMiner components.  Logically combining components in a view allows the user to quickly access all components that belong together in some way. |
| A redundancy Group | A group of devices that have been configured in such a way that if one or more of them fail, others can take over automatically. |
| NOTE               | For mor information about these components, refer to the relevant section in [Basic DataMiner Functionality](here). |





DataMiner functionalities

The following concepts pertain to the way DataMiner gathers and
visualizes information about your system:

| Concept                              | Description                          |
+======================================+======================================+
| A protocol                           | An XML file that allows the DMA to   |
|                                      | communicate with a data source in    |
|                                      | the system. Also known as            |
|                                      | “connector” or “driver”. See also:   |

| A visual overview                    | A graphical representation of        |
|                                      | components and data in the system.   |
|                                      | The visual overviews in DataMiner    |
|                                      | are created in Microsoft Visio, and  |
|                                      | can represent information in many    |
|                                      | different ways. They can also be     |
|                                      | made interactive, so that the user   |
|                                      | can interact with the DataMiner      |
|                                      | system by clicking areas in the      |

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| An alarm                             | A notification that a parameter      |
|                                      | value has crossed a particular       |
|                                      | threshold, or a parameter has        |
|                                      | attained a particular value. With    |
|                                      | alarms, users are made aware of any  |
|                                      | abnormal situation in the system.    |
|                                      | Alarms can have different severity   |
|                                      | levels, and may be linked to other   |
|                                      | alarms.                              |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Trending                             | DataMiner can store measurements of  |
|                                      | parameter values, taken over a       |
|                                      | period of time, so that these can be |
|                                      | shown in graphs to visualize trends  |
|                                      | in the system.                       |

DataMiner modules

A DataMiner System can have several additional modules or apps.
Depending on the type of DataMiner license you have, these may or may
not be available in your system. However, as some of these modules are
mentioned quite often throughout the documentation, it is useful to know
what they are, even if you will not use them yourself.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

|                                      | about components of the system.      |
|                                      | These dashboards can be viewed       |
|                                      | separately from the main DataMiner   |

DataMiner Standard Apps

The DataMiner Standard Apps combine different DataMiner features into
one ready-made package that can easily be deployed in a DataMiner
System.

The package contains all the necessary components and default
configurations, including protocols, views, Automation scripts, etc.
Certain DataMiner features and licenses can be required as
prerequisites, depending on the app.
